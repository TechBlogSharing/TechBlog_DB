    "description": "The memory-efficient doubly linked list uses only one pointer to traverse the list in both directions. This is achieved by using a bitwise XOR operator to store the front and rear pointer addresses. Rather than storing the actual memory addresses, each node stores the XOR address of the previous and next nodes."
